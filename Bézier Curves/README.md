# Overview
Bézier curves are widely used by many mathematicians, software engineers, computer graphics engineers, designers and other professional individuals in their work. They are one of the most famous curves and their formation is immensely easy to understand for newbies. The curves, which are related to Bernstein polynomials, are named after French engineer Pierre Bézier, who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars. The formation of Bézier curves is quite interesting.
