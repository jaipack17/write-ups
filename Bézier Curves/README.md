# Overview
Bézier curves are widely used by many mathematicians, software engineers, computer graphics engineers, designers and other professional individuals in their work. They are one of the most famous curves and their formation is immensely easy to understand for newbies. The curves, which are related to Bernstein polynomials, are named after French engineer Pierre Bézier, who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars. The formation of Bézier curves is quite interesting.

Bézier curves are formed using nested/multiple Linear Interpolations. Let's understand what a Linear Interpolation is, but before that here are some optional Prerequisites.

# Linear Interpolation

Initially in this article, I introduced a new term for some of you, "Linear Interpolation". Linear Interpolation or in short lerp, is a mathematical method for finding way points on a straight ray, line segment or line. If two points are known, infinite points can be calculated on a straight path connected to these two points. We refer these 2 points as 'anchor points'. We'll see how Bézier curves make the use of Linear Interpolation.

Suppose you have a line segment with two endpoints P0 and P1. How would you go about finding way points on this line segment? Here's where the concept of linear interpolation kicks in.

Consider a percentage value between 0 and 1 where 0.1 denotes 10%, 0.25 denotes 25%, 0.97 denotes 97% and so on. We use this percentage value to calculate a way point on the line segment. Example: let the percentage value be 0.5 (50%), using linear interpolation we'll be able to calculate the mid-point of the line segment.

Lets denote this percentage value by the letter 't' by standards.
