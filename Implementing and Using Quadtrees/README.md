# Preface

Quadtrees are tree based data structures used prevalently in game development and computer graphics. These trees precisely have 4 subdivisions/nodes. Recursion is usually used to create subdivisions/nodes in the tree. You might have heard about octrees before. Octrees are similar to quadtrees but unlike quadtrees, octrees are 3 dimensional and have 8 subdivisions that are cubes. These nodes, if visualizaed usually are squares, and their subdivisions are squares smaller than their parent node. Quadtrees are used in collision detection, game engines, image processing, mesh generation etc. In this article, we cover implementation, visualization of quadtrees as well collision detection with quadtrees. I also assume you know the basic architecture of how tree data structures work. If you aren't yet familiar with trees, consider checking them out before this article!
