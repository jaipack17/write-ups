In game development and computer graphics, one of the trickiest problem is simulating Collisions between two arbritary elements. Many find collision detection to be fairly easy (which is justified), but fail to simulate elastic collision responses. In this article, we'll look into a mathematical theorem which goes by the name of "Separating Axis Theorem". Some of the other articles over here, or even my custom physics engine uses this theorem to detect and respond to elastic collisions.
