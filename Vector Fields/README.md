As many of you may know, a vector has both a direction and a magnitude. You may already have used vectors in game development, programming and mathematics in general. Take a look at the image on the left to have a better understanding of a vector. Vector fields if not grids, but are a group of points in uniform order that are assigned different vectors. These points act as the 'tail' or the 'starting point' of the vector. These vectors are generalized and visualized as arrows with a direction and a magnitude.

Vector fields are used for several purposes, usually to have an understanding of the movement of fluid particles, gravitational forces, magnetic forces and atmospheric pressure.
